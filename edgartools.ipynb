Annuity contracts are valued at fair value using the net present value of future cash flows.\\nIn accordance with ASC 820-10, certain investments that were measured at net asset value per share (or its equivalent) have not been classified in the fair value hierarchy. The fair value amounts presented in this table are intended to permit reconciliation of the fair value hierarchy to the fair value of plan assets at the end of the year.\\nActivity primarily represents amounts written-off during the year, along with other adjustments (primarily foreign currency translation adjustments).\\nThese accumulated other comprehensive income components are included in the computation of net periodic pension cost (see Note G, \"Pension and Other Postretirement Benefit Plans\" for further details).\\nCommon stock is valued at the closing price reported on the active market on which the individual securities are traded.

Twin Disc designs, manufactures and sells marine and heavy duty off‑highway power transmission equipment. The Company has manufacturing locations in the United States, Belgium, Italy, Switzerland and the Netherlands. In addition to these countries, it has distribution locations in Singapore, China, Australia and Japan. Products offered include: marine transmissions, azimuth drives, surface drives, propellers and boat management systems as well as power-shift transmissions, hydraulic torque converters, power take-offs, industrial clutches and controls systems. The Company sells its products to customers primarily in the pleasure craft, commercial and military marine markets, as well as in the energy and natural resources, government and industrial markets. The Company\\'s worldwide sales to both domestic and foreign customers are transacted through a direct sales force and a distributor network. The products described above have accounted for more than 90% of revenues in each of the last three fiscal years.\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\nMost of the Company\\'s products are machined from cast iron, forgings, cast aluminum and bar steel which generally are available from multiple sources and which are believed to be in adequate supply.\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\nThe Company has applied for patents in both the United States and certain foreign countries on inventions made in the course of its development work for which commercial applications are considered probable. The Company regards its patents collectively as important but does not consider its business dependent upon any one of such patents.\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\nThe business is not considered to be seasonal except to the extent that employee vacations and plant shutdowns, particularly in Europe, occur mainly in the months of July and August, curtailing production during that period.\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\nThe Company\\'s products receive direct widespread competition, including from divisions of other larger independent manufacturers. The Company also competes for business with parts manufacturing divisions of some of its major customers. The primary competitive factors for the Company’s products are design, technology, performance, price, service and availability. The Company’s top ten customers accounted for approximately 47% and 50% of the Company\\'s consolidated net sales during the years ended June 30, 2023 and June 30, 2022, respectively. Included in the Company’s top ten customers, there was one customer, an authorized distributor of the Company, that accounted for 10% of consolidated net sales in fiscal year 2023.\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\nUnfilled open orders for the next six months of $119.2 million at June 30, 2023 compares to $101.2 million at June 30, 2022. Since orders are subject to cancellation and rescheduling by the customer, the six‑month order backlog is considered more representative of operating conditions than total backlog. However, as procurement and manufacturing \"lead times\" change, the backlog will increase or decrease, and thus it does not necessarily provide a valid indicator of the shipping rate. Cancellations are generally the result of rescheduling activity and do not represent a material change in total backlog.\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\nManagement recognizes that there are attendant risks that foreign governments may place restrictions on dividend payments and other movements of money, but these risks are considered low due to the relatively low investment within individual countries that have currency movement restrictions. No material portion of the Company’s business is subject to renegotiation of profits or termination of contracts at the election of the U.S. government.\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\nEngineering and development costs include research and development expenses for new product development and major improvements to existing products, and other costs for ongoing efforts to refine existing products. Research and development costs charged to operations totaled $2.5 million and $1.6 million in fiscal 2023 and 2022, respectively. Total engineering and development costs were $8.7 million and $8.8 million in fiscal 2023 and 2022, respectively.\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\nCompliance with federal, state and local provisions regulating the discharge of materials into the environment, or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment, is not anticipated to have a material effect on capital expenditures, earnings or the competitive position of the Company.\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n 4\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n---\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\xa0\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\nThe number of persons employed by the Company at June 30, 2023 and June 30, 2022 was 739 and 761, respectively. The Company believes that its continued success is a direct result of its talent. As such, the Company strives to be an employer of choice in every community in which it operates. It does this by fostering a fair, respectful, inclusive and safe work environment and culture shaped with its core values of customer focus, integrity, accountability, teamwork, and innovation.\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\nA summary of financial data by segment, geographic area, and classes of products that accounted for more than 10% of consolidated sales revenues for the years ended June 30, 2023 and 2022 appears in Note J, Business Segments and Foreign Operations, to the consolidated financial statements.\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\nThe Company’s website address is www.twindisc.com. **The Company makes available free of charge (other than an investor**’**s own internet access charges) through its website the Company**’**s Annual Report on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and current reports on Form 8-K, and amendments to those reports, as soon as reasonably practicable after it electronically files such material with, or furnishes such material to, the United States Securities and Exchange Commission.** The SEC maintains an internet site (www.sec.gov) that contains reports, proxy and information statements, and other information regarding issuers, such as the Company, that file electronically with the SEC. In addition, the Company makes available, through its website, important corporate governance materials. This information is also available from the Company upon request. The Company is not including the information contained on or available through its website as a part of, or incorporating such information by reference to, this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n**Item 1A.\\xa0 Risk Factors**\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\nThe Company’s business involves various risk factors. The following information about these risks should be considered carefully together with other information contained in this report. The risks described below are not the only risks the Company faces. Additional risks not currently known, deemed immaterial or that could apply to any issuer may also result in adverse results for the Company’s business.\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n***As a global company, the Company is subject to currency fluctuations and a significant movement between the U.S. dollar and the euro exchange rate, in particular, could have an adverse effect on its profitability.***  Although the Company’s financial results are reported in U.S. dollars, a significant portion of its sales and operating costs are realized in euros and other foreign currencies. The Company’s profitability is affected by movements of the U.S. dollar against the euro and the other currencies in which it generates revenues and incurs expenses. Significant long-term fluctuations in relative currency values, in particular a significant change in the exchange rate between the U.S. dollar and the euro, could have an adverse effect on the Company’s profitability and financial condition.\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n***The Company continues to be adversely affected by the economic disruptions caused by the global coronavirus pandemic.***\\xa0In March 2020, the World Health Organization (“WHO”) declared that a new strain of coronavirus that originated in Wuhan, China, and has rapidly spread around the world (“COVID-19”) is a pandemic that poses significant risk to the international community.\\xa0 This outbreak contributed to shelter-in-place policies, unexpected factory closures, supply chain disruptions, and market volatility causing substantial declines in market capitalization, and occurring in the midst of an already challenging economic environment in some of our markets, most notably the oil and gas market.\\xa0 As a result of the outbreak, starting in March 2020 and intermittently through June 30, 2023, the Company suspended or reduced its operations, in whole or in part, in several of its locations. The Company’s businesses operate in market segments impacted by COVID-19.\\xa0 Operating during a global pandemic has exposed the Company to a number of material risks, including diminished demand for our products and our customers’ products, suspensions in the operations of our and our suppliers’ manufacturing facilities, maintenance of appropriate labor levels, our ability to ship products to our customers, interruptions in our supply chains and distribution systems, access to capital and potential increases to the cost of capital, collection of trade receivables in accordance with their terms and potential further impairment of long-lived assets; all of which, in the aggregate, have had an adverse effect on the Company’s business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Management continues to monitor the global situation and its effect on financial condition, liquidity, operations, suppliers, industry and workforce.\\xa0 The Company remains unable to estimate the full extent or nature of the impact of COVID-19.\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n 5\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n---\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\xa0\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n***Certain of the Company***’***s products are directly or indirectly used in oil exploration and oil drilling and are thus dependent upon the strength of those markets and oil prices.*** In recent years, the Company has seen significant variations in the sales of its products that are used in oil and energy related markets. The variability in these markets has been defined by the change in oil prices and the global demand for oil. Significant decreases in oil prices and reduced demand for oil and capital investment in the oil and energy markets adversely affect the sales of these products and the Company’s profitability. The cyclical nature of the global oil and gas market presents the ongoing possibility of a severe cutback in demand, which would create a significant adverse effect on the sales of these products and ultimately on the Company’s profitability.\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n***Many of the Company***’***s product markets are cyclical in nature or are otherwise sensitive to volatile or unpredictable factors. A downturn or weakness in overall economic activity or fluctuations in those other factors could have a material adverse effect on the Company***’***s overall financial performance***. Historically, sales of many of the products that the Company manufactures and sells have been subject to cyclical variations caused by changes in general economic conditions and other factors. In particular, the Company sells its products to customers primarily in the pleasure craft, commercial and military marine markets, as well as in the energy and natural resources, government and industrial markets. The demand for the products may be impacted by the strength of the economy generally, governmental spending and appropriations, including security and defense outlays, fuel prices, interest rates, as well as many other factors. Adverse economic and other conditions may cause the Company\\'s customers to forego or otherwise postpone purchases in favor of repairing existing equipment.\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n***In the event of an increase in the global demand for steel, the Company could be adversely affected if it experiences shortages of raw castings and forgings used in the manufacturing of its products.***  With the continued advancement of certain developing economies, in particular China and India, the global demand for steel has risen significantly in recent years. The Company selects its suppliers based on a number of criteria, and the Company expects that they will be able to support its needs. However, there can be no assurance that a significant increase in demand, capacity constraints or other issues experienced by the Company’s suppliers will not result in shortages or delays in their supply of raw materials to the Company. If the Company were to experience a significant or prolonged shortage of critical components from any of its suppliers, particularly those who are sole sources, and could not procure the components from other sources, the Company would be unable to meet its production schedules for some of its key products and would miss product delivery dates which would adversely affect its sales, profitability and relationships with its customers.\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n***The Company continues to face the prospect of increasing commodity costs, including steel, other raw materials and energy that could have an adverse effect on future profitability. In addition, developments in tariff regulations in the U.S. and foreign jurisdictions have resulted in uncertainty regarding international trade policies and future commodity prices, contributing to an increased risk of higher commodity costs that could have an adverse impact on the Company***’***s profitability, financial condition and results of operations.*** The Company’s profitability is dependent, in part, on commodity costs. To date, the Company has been successful with offsetting the effects of increased commodity costs through cost reduction programs and pricing actions. However, if material prices were to continue to increase at a rate that could not be recouped through product pricing or cost reductions, it could potentially have an adverse effect on the Company’s future profitability.\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\nThe Company anticipates that additional tariffs or trade restrictions resulting from “trade wars” could result in an increase in its cost of sales and there can be no assurance that the Company would be able to pass any of the increases in raw material costs directly resulting from additional tariffs to its customers. Given that it procures many of the raw materials that it uses to create its products directly or indirectly from outside of the United States, the imposition of tariffs and other potential changes in U.S. trade policy could increase the cost or limit the availability of such raw materials, which could hurt its competitive position and adversely impact its business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, the Company sells a significant proportion of its products to customers outside of the United States. Retaliatory actions by other countries could result in increases in the price of its products, which could limit demand for such products, hurt its global competitive position and have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, financial condition and results of operations.\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n 6\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n---\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\xa0\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n***If the Company were to lose business with any key customers, the Company***’***s business would be adversely affected.*** Although there was only one customer that accounted for 10% or more of consolidated net sales in fiscal 2023, deterioration of a business relationship with one or more of the Company’s significant customers would cause its sales and profitability to be adversely affected. Although the Company’s accounts receivable are dispersed among a large customer base, a significant change in the liquidity or financial position of any one of its largest customers could have a material adverse impact on the collectability of its accounts receivable and future operating results.\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n***The termination of relationships with the Company***’***s suppliers, or the inability of such suppliers to perform, could disrupt its business and have an adverse effect on its ability to manufacture and deliver products.*** The Company relies on raw materials, component parts, and services supplied by outside third parties. If a supplier of significant raw materials, component parts or services were to terminate its relationship with the Company, or otherwise cease supplying raw materials, component parts, or services consistent with past practice, the Company’s ability to meet its obligations to its customers may be affected. Such a disruption with respect to numerous products, or with respect to a few significant products, could have an adverse effect on the Company’s profitability and financial condition.\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n***A significant design, manufacturing or supplier quality issue could result in recalls or other actions by the Company that could adversely affect profitability.***  As a manufacturer of highly engineered products, the performance, reliability and productivity of the Company’s products are some of its competitive advantages. While the Company prides itself on implementing procedures to ensure the quality and performance of its products and suppliers, a significant quality or product issue, whether due to design, performance, manufacturing or supplier quality issue, could lead to warranty actions, scrapping of raw materials, finished goods or returned products, the deterioration in a customer relationship, or other action that could adversely affect warranty and quality costs, future sales and profitability.\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n***The Company faces risks associated with its international sales and operations that could adversely affect its business, results of operations or financial condition.*** Sales to customers outside the United States approximated 65% of the Company’s consolidated net sales for fiscal 2023. The Company has international manufacturing operations in Belgium, Italy, the Netherlands and Switzerland. In addition, the Company has international distribution operations in Singapore, China, Australia, Japan, Italy, Belgium, and India. The Company’s international sales and operations are subject to a number of risks, including:\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n|  |  |  |\\n| --- | --- | --- |\\n|  | \\npic1.jpg | currency exchange rate fluctuations |\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n|  |  |  |\\n| --- | --- | --- |\\n|  | pic1.jpg | export and import duties, changes to import and export regulations, and restrictions on the transfer of funds, including dividends |\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n|  |  |  |\\n| --- | --- | --- |\\n|  | pic1.jpg | problems with the transportation or delivery of its products |\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n|  |  |  |\\n| --- | --- | --- |\\n|  | pic1.jpg | issues arising from cultural or language differences |\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n|  |  |  |\\n| --- | --- | --- |\\n|  | pic1.jpg | potential social and labor unrest as well as public health and political crises |\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n|  |  |  |\\n| --- | --- | --- |\\n|  | pic1.jpg | longer payment cycles and greater difficulty in collecting accounts receivables |\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n|  |  |  |\\n| --- | --- | --- |\\n|  | pic1.jpg | compliance with trade and other laws in a variety of jurisdictions |\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n|  |  |  |\\n| --- | --- | --- |\\n|  | pic1.jpg | changes in tax law |\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n|  |  |  |\\n| --- | --- | --- |\\n|  | pic1.jpg | compliance with the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act |\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\nThese factors could adversely affect the Company’s business, results of operations or financial condition.\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n***A material disruption at the Company***’***s manufacturing facility in Racine, Wisconsin could adversely affect its ability to generate sales and meet customer demand.*** The majority of the Company’s manufacturing, based on fiscal 2023 sales, came from its facility in Racine, Wisconsin. If operations at this facility were to be disrupted as a result of significant equipment failures, natural disasters, power outages, fires, explosions, adverse weather conditions, labor force disruptions or other reasons, the Company’s business and results of operations could be adversely affected. Interruptions in production would increase costs and reduce sales. Any interruption in production capability could require the Company to make substantial capital expenditures to remedy the situation, which could negatively affect its profitability and financial condition. The Company maintains property damage insurance which it believes is adequate to reconstruct its facilities and equipment, as well as business interruption insurance to mitigate losses resulting from any production interruption or shutdown caused by an insured loss. However, any recovery under this insurance policy may not offset the lost sales or increased costs that may be experienced during the disruption of operations. Lost sales may not be recoverable under the policy and long-term business disruptions could result in a loss of customers. If this were to occur, future sales levels and costs of doing business, and therefore profitability, could be adversely affected.\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n 7\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n---\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\xa0\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n***The ability to service the requirements of debt depends on the ability to generate cash and/or refinance its indebtedness as it becomes due, and depends on many factors, some of which are beyond the Company***’***s control.*** The Company entered into a credit agreement on June 29, 2018. The Company’s ability to make payments on its indebtedness, including those under the credit agreement, and to fund planned capital expenditures, research and development efforts and other corporate expenses depends on the Company’s future operating performance and on economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors. Many of these factors are beyond its control. The Company cannot be certain that its business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations, or operating improvements will be realized or that future borrowings will be available to it in an amount sufficient to enable it to repay its indebtedness or to fund its other operating requirements. Significant delays in its planned capital expenditures may materially and adversely affect the Company’s future revenue prospects.\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n***Any failure to meet debt obligations and financial covenants, and maintain adequate asset-based borrowing capacity could adversely affect the Company***’***s business and financial condition.***\\xa0 The Company’s three-year revolving credit facility expiring June 2025 is secured by certain personal property assets such as accounts receivable, inventory, and machinery and equipment.\\xa0 Under this agreement, the Company’s borrowing capacity is based on the eligible balances of these assets and it is required to maintain sufficient asset levels at all times to secure its outstanding borrowings.\\xa0 The Company is also required to comply with a total funded debt to EBITDA ratio, a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio, and a minimum tangible net worth.\\xa0 If the Company does not meet these financial covenants as specified under the agreement, the Company may require forbearance or relief from its financial covenant violations from its senior lender or be required to arrange alternative financing.\\xa0Failure to obtain relief from financial covenant violations or to obtain alternative financing, if necessary, would have a material adverse impact on the Company.\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\nAs of June 30, 2023, the Company had a borrowing capacity that exceeded its outstanding loan balance (see Note G, Debt, of the notes to the consolidated financial statements). Based on its annual financial plan, the Company believes that it will generate sufficient cash flow levels throughout fiscal 2024 to meet the required financial covenants under the agreements. However, as with all forward-looking information, there can be no assurance that the Company will achieve the planned results in future periods.\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n***While the Company has obtained forgiveness of its Paycheck Protection Program Loan (***“***PPP loan***”***), it remains subject to audit under the program***’***s rules and any resulting adverse audit findings of non-compliance can result in the repayment of a portion or all of the PPP loan.***\\xa0On April 17, 2020 the Company received proceeds of $8.2 million from a loan under the PPP of the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (“CARES Act”), which it has used to retain employees, maintain payroll and make lease and utility payments.\\xa0 The Company accounted for the full proceeds as a loan.\\xa0 It obtained formal forgiveness of the full amount of the loan on June 16, 2021, and accounted for the forgiveness as income from extinguishment of loan in its statement of operations for the year ended June 30, 2021.\\xa0 \\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\nWhile the loan has been formally forgiven, under the terms of the PPP Loan, the Company remains subject to an audit by the Small Business Administration (“SBA”) for a period of six years after forgiveness.\\xa0 The audit is intended to confirm the Company’s eligibility for the PPP loan and the appropriateness of the PPP loan forgiveness. The Company is aware of the requirements of the PPP Loan and believes it is within the eligibility threshold and has used the loan proceeds in accordance with PPP loan forgiveness requirements. It has retained all necessary documentation in support of its eligibility, including gross receipts calculations, supporting payroll expenses and related information. However, no assurance is provided that the Company will satisfy fully all the requirements of an audit. If despite the Company’s actions and certification that it satisfied all eligibility requirements for the PPP loan, it is later determined that it violated applicable laws or was otherwise ineligible to receive the PPP loan, it may be required to repay the PPP loan in its entirety in a lump sum or be subject to additional penalties, which could result in adverse publicity and damage to the Company’s reputation. If these events were to transpire, they could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition.\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n 8\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n---\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\xa0\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n***The Company carries a significant amount of intangible assets, but it may never fully realize the full value of these assets.*** The Company recorded significant non-cash goodwill impairment charges in fiscal 2020, as well as in prior fiscal years. As part of the acquisition of Veth Propulsion in July 2018, the Company acquired goodwill and intangible assets in the form of customer relationships, technology and knowhow and tradenames. In fiscal 2020, due to its assessment of the adverse economic consequences of the COVID-19 outbreak and the negative trends in its markets as explained in Note D, Intangible Assets, the Company recorded significant impairment charges, writing off all the goodwill in its books, as well as writing down some intangibles and other assets. In fiscal 2017 and 2016, when the Company’s markets were significantly adversely affected by the global oil and gas decline, it recorded significant impairment charges related to two of its prior acquisitions. Any deterioration in the industries or businesses of the Company may trigger future non-cash impairment charges, which may have a material adverse effect to the Company’s financial results.\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n***The Company may experience negative or unforeseen tax consequences.*** The Company reviews the probability of the realization of its net deferred tax assets each period based on forecasts of taxable income in both the U.S. and foreign jurisdictions. This review uses historical results, projected future operating results based upon approved business plans, eligible carryforward periods, tax planning opportunities and other relevant considerations. Adverse changes in the profitability and financial outlook in the U.S. or foreign jurisdictions may require the creation of a valuation allowance to reduce the Company’s net deferred tax assets. Such changes could result in material non-cash expenses in the period in which the changes are made and could have a material adverse impact on the Company’s results of operations and financial condition. In fiscal 2021, the Company recorded a 100% allowance on its domestic deferred tax assets, totaling $15.9 million. At June 30, 2023 and 2022, the allowance totaled $22.3 million and $23.1\\xa0million, respectively.\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n***Taxing authority challenges and changes to tax laws may lead to tax payments exceeding current reserves.***The Company is subject to ongoing tax examinations in various jurisdictions. As a result, the Company may record incremental tax expense based on expected outcomes of such matters. In addition, the Company may adjust previously reported tax reserves based on expected results of these examinations. Such adjustments could result in an increase or decrease to the Company’s effective tax rate.\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\nFuture changes in tax law in the United States or the various jurisdictions in which the Company operates and income tax holidays could have a material impact on the Company’s effective tax rate, foreign rate differential, future income tax expense and cash flows.\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n***Security breaches and other disruptions could compromise the Company***’***s information system and expose the Company to liabilities, which would cause its business and reputation to suffer.*** In the ordinary course of its business, the Company collects and stores sensitive data, including its proprietary business information and that of its customers, suppliers and business partners, as well as personally identifiable information of its customers and employees, in its internal and external data centers, cloud services and on its networks. The secure processing, maintenance and transmission of this information is critical to the Company’s operations and business strategy. Despite the Company’s security measures, its information technology and infrastructure, and that of its partners, may be vulnerable to malicious attacks or breaches due to employee error, malfeasance or other disruptions, including as a result of rollouts of new systems. Any such breach or operational failure would compromise the Company’s networks and/or that of its partners and the information stored there could be accessed, publicly disclosed, lost or stolen.

The Company continued to experience growing demand across most of the markets served, following the unfavorable impact of the COVID-19 crisis on the Company’s global markets in fiscal 2020 and 2021. While market demand was strong through the year, supply chain challenges again limited the Company’s ability to deliver product during the fiscal year. The Company noted improving supply chain performance through the year, delivering sequential revenue improvements through the four quarters of fiscal 2023. Currency translation had an unfavorable impact on fiscal 2023 sales compared to the prior year totaling $11.5 million, primarily due to the weakening of the euro and Australian dollar against the U.S. dollar.\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\nSales for our manufacturing segment increased 12.2%, or $26.6 million, versus the same period last year. The largest improvement was seen at the Company’s Veth propulsion operation in the Netherlands, which experienced a 17.1% increase in sales compared to fiscal 2022 despite a $3.2 million unfavorable currency translation impact. The primary driver for this increase was growing demand for the Company’s innovative propulsion solutions around the globe, partially offset by supply chain challenges limiting shipments. The Company’s domestic manufacturing operation experienced a 9.6% increase in sales in fiscal 2023, driven by continued strong demand across the product portfolio, with particular strength in demand for oil and gas related products for both new construction and rebuilds. The Company’s Italian manufacturing operations reported a 14.4% increase in sales from fiscal 2022, despite an unfavorable currency translation impact, thanks to recovering European markets following the negative impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. The Company’s Belgian manufacturing operation saw a 12.3% increase in sales from fiscal 2022 despite an unfavorable foreign exchange impact, with strength in the global marine markets it serves. The Company’s Swiss manufacturing operation, which supplies customized propellers for the global mega yacht and patrol boat markets, experienced a 16.4% increase in sales compared to fiscal 2022, primarily due to a recovering European marine market.\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n 12\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n---\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\xa0\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\nSales for our distribution segment were up 14.3%, or $15.2 million, compared to fiscal 2022, with improving global demand and product delivery from the manufacturing operations. The Company’s Asian distribution operation in Singapore, China and Japan experienced a 7.4% increase in sales due to the recovering global demand following the impacts of COVID-19 and continued strength in Chinese demand for oil and gas related products. The Company’s European distribution operation saw a slight increase in sales of 2.1%, as improving demand was offset by an unfavorable currency translation impact and supply chain challenges limiting shipment of goods from the production operations. The Company’s North American distribution operation experienced significant revenue growth of 35.7% as supply chain challenges eased somewhat, allowing for a catch-up in deliveries against a strong demand backdrop. The Company’s distribution operation in Australia, which provides boat accessories, propulsion and marine transmission systems primarily for the pleasure craft market, saw a 14.4% sales increase, driven by strong demand for the Company’s product in the pleasure craft market.\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\nNet sales for the Company’s marine transmission, propulsion and boat management systems were up 17.2% in fiscal 2023 compared to the prior fiscal year. This increase reflects a general strengthening of the global economy following the negative impact of the COVID-19 pandemic in fiscal 2022, continued global growth of the Veth product and a general easing of supply chain constraints during the second half of the fiscal year. In the off-highway transmission market, the year-over-year increase of 12.5% can also be attributed primarily to the global recovery following the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, with particular strength in North American aftermarket product sales for the oil and gas industry. Sale of the Company’s pressure pumping transmission systems into China also remains strong. The decrease experienced in the Company’s industrial products of 7.2% was a function of a stronger fiscal 2022 driven by the catch-up in demand after a pause during the COVID-19 pandemic, along with a softening in order rates during the second half of the fiscal year.\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\nGeographically, sales to the U.S. and Canada improved 22% in fiscal 2023 compared to fiscal 2022, representing 38% of consolidated sales for fiscal 2023 compared to 36% in fiscal 2022. The increase is primarily due to the continuing economic recovery following the COVID-19 pandemic, with strong demand experienced across the markets served by the Company. Sales into the Asia Pacific market improved 13% compared to fiscal 2022 and represented approximately 23% of sales in fiscal 2023, compared to 23% in fiscal 2022. The increase in fiscal 2023 reflects a continued strong Australian pleasure craft market, continued demand for the Company’s oil and gas transmissions by the Chinese market and a general economic recovery following the COVID-19 pandemic. Sales into the European market improved approximately 11% from fiscal 2022 levels while accounting for 30% of consolidated net sales in fiscal 2023 compared to 31% of net sales in fiscal 2022. The region enjoyed strong demand across the end markets served, limited somewhat by supply chain challenges, but overcoming an unfavorable currency exchange impact. See Note J, Business Segments and Foreign Operations, of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for more information on the Company’s business segments and foreign operations.\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n*Gross Profit*\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\nIn fiscal 2023, gross profit improved $5.5 million, or 8.0%, to $74.3 million on a sales increase of $34.0 million. Gross profit as a percentage of sales decreased 150 basis points in fiscal 2023 to 26.8%, compared to 28.3% in fiscal 2022.\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\nThere were a number of factors that impacted the Company’s overall gross profit rate in fiscal 2023. Gross profit for the year was primarily impacted by improved volumes (approximately $9.6 million) and a more favorable product mix (approximately $1.5 million). This was driven by the global economic recovery that started in fiscal 2021 following the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and an increase in the sales of high-margin oil and gas transmissions and parts. The Company experienced a negative impact to margins from inflationary cost pressures, primarily through the first three quarters of the fiscal year ($3.7 million). In addition, the prior year result included the net favorable impact on margins from the recording of benefits related to COVID-19 relief programs of the U.S. and the Netherlands, totaling $2.0 million.\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n*Marketing, Engineering and Administrative (ME&A) Expenses*\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\nMarketing, engineering, and administrative (ME&A) expenses of $62.2 million were up $2.2 million, or 3.6%, in fiscal 2023 compared to the prior fiscal year. As a percentage of sales, ME&A expenses decreased to 22.5% of sales versus 24.7% of sales in fiscal 2022. The increase in ME&A spending in fiscal 2023 compared to the prior year was driven by the incremental impact of prior year COVID subsidies ($2.1 million), increased professional fees ($0.7 million), increased salaries and benefits ($0.8 million), increased marketing activities ($0.9 million), higher travel expense ($0.7 million) and increased stock-based compensation ($0.6 million). These increases were partially offset by a reduction in the global bonus expense ($2.0 million) and a currency exchange driven decrease ($1.6 million).\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n 13\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n---\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\xa0\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n*Restructuring of Operations*\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\nDuring the course of fiscal 2023 and fiscal 2022 the Company incurred $0.2 million and $1.0 million in restructuring charges, respectively. These charges relate to a continued restructuring program at the Company’s Belgian operation to focus resources on core manufacturing process, while allowing for savings on the outsourcing of non-core processes.\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n*Interest Expense*\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\nInterest expense of $2.3 million for fiscal 2023 was $0.2 million higher than fiscal 2022 due to an increased average interest rate, partially offset by a lower average balance on the domestic revolver.\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n*Other Income, Net*\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\nIn fiscal 2023, other income, net, of $0.7 million declined by $3.0 million from the prior fiscal year other income, net, of $3.7 million. This change is primarily due to the impact of currency movements related to the euro.\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n*Income Taxes*\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\nThe effective tax rate for fiscal 2023 is 26.2% compared to 14.5% for fiscal 2022.\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\nThe Company maintains valuation allowances when it is more likely than not that all or a portion of a deferred tax asset will not be realized. Changes in valuation allowances from period to period are included in the tax provision in the period of change. In determining whether a valuation allowance is required, the Company takes into account such factors as prior earnings history, expected future earnings, carry-back and carry-forward periods, and tax strategies that could potentially enhance the likelihood of realization of a deferred tax asset. In fiscal 2021, the Company evaluated the likelihood of whether the net domestic deferred tax assets would be realized and concluded that it is more likely than not that all of deferred tax assets would not be realized. Management believes that it is more likely than not that the results of future operations will not generate sufficient taxable income and foreign source income to realize all the domestic deferred tax assets, therefore, a valuation allowance in the amount of $15.9 million, was included in income tax expense (benefit) on the consolidated statement of operations, for fiscal year 2021. In fiscal year 2023 and 2022, the valuation allowance was $22.3 million and $23.1\\xa0million, respectively.\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n*Order Rates*\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\nAs of June 30, 2023, the Company’s backlog of orders scheduled for shipment during the next six months (six-month backlog) was $119.2 million or approximately 18% higher than the six-month backlog of $101.2 million as of June 30, 2022. The increased backlog is primarily attributable to the improvement in order rates throughout the fiscal year resulting from the global economic recovery following the negative impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n***Liquidity and Capital Resources***\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n*Fiscal Years 2023 and 2022*\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\nThe net cash provided by operating activities in fiscal 2023 totaled $22.9 million, an improvement of $31.2 million from the prior fiscal year cash used by operating activities of $8.3 million. The positive operating cash flow was created primarily by a strong earnings result and volume driven increases in current liabilities, only partially offset by an increase to trade receivables and a well-controlled inventory increase despite the volume gains. The Company has begun to make progress on its inventory reduction initiatives, driving a $4.9 million decrease during the second half of fiscal 2023.\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\nThe net cash used by investing activities for fiscal 2023 primarily represents capital spending of $7.9 million, partially offset by the sales of fixed assets totaling $7.2 million. The capital spending amount reflects a return to somewhat normalized capital spending levels, somewhat hampered by extended lead times on equipment resulting from global supply chain challenges.\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n 14\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n---\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\xa0\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\nThe net cash used by financing activities relates primarily to repayments of long-term debt ($18.2 million), along with payments for withholding taxes on stock compensation ($0.5 million), payments on finance lease obligations ($0.6 million) and dividends paid to a non-controlling interest ($0.2 million). During fiscal 2023, the Company did not purchase any shares as part of its Board-authorized stock repurchase program. The Company has 315,000 shares remaining under its authorized stock repurchase plan.\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n*Future Liquidity and Capital Resources*\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\nOn June 29, 2018, the Company entered into a Credit Agreement (the “Credit Agreement”) with BMO Harris Bank N.A. (“BMO”) that provided for the assignment and assumption of the previously existing loans between the Company and Bank of Montreal (the “2016 Credit Agreement”) and subsequent amendments into a term loan (the “Term Loan”) and revolving credit loans (each a “Revolving Loan” and, collectively, the “Revolving Loans,” and, together with the Term Loan, the “Loans”). Pursuant to the Credit Agreement, BMO agreed to make the Term Loan to the Company in a principal amount not to exceed $35.0 million and the Company may, from time to time prior to the maturity date, enter into Revolving Loans in amounts not to exceed, in the aggregate, $50.0 million (the “Revolving Credit Commitment”), subject to a Borrowing Base based on Eligible Inventory and Eligible Receivables. Subsequent amendments to the Credit Agreement reduced the Term Loan to $20.0 million, extended the maturity date of the Term Loan to March 4, 2026, and require the Company to make principal installment payments on the Term Loan of $0.5 million per quarter. In addition, under subsequent amendments to the Credit Agreement, BMO’s Revolving Credit Commitment is currently $40.0 million. The Credit Agreement also allows the Company to obtain Letters of Credit from BMO, which if drawn upon by the beneficiary thereof and paid by BMO, would become Revolving Loans. Under the Credit Agreement, the Company may not pay cash dividends on its common stock in excess of $3.0 million in any fiscal year. The term of the Revolving Loans under the Credit Agreement currently runs through June 30, 2025.\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\nUnder the Credit Agreement as amended, interest rates are based on either the secured overnight financing rate (“SOFR”) or the euro interbank offered rate (the “EURIBO Rate”). Loans are designated either as “SOFR Loans,” which accrue interest at an Adjusted Term SOFR plus an Applicable Margin, or “Eurodollar Loans,” which accrue interest at the EURIBO Rate plus an Applicable Margin. Amounts drawn on a Letter of Credit that are not timely reimbursed to the Bank bear interest at a Base Rate plus an Applicable Margin. The Company also pays a commitment fee on the average daily Unused Revolving Credit Commitment equal to an Applicable Margin. Currently, the Applicable Margins are between 1.25% and 2.75% for Revolving Loans and Letters of Credit; 1.375% and 2.875% for Term Loans; and .10% and .15% for the Unused Revolving Credit Commitment (each depending on the Company’s Total Funded Debt to EBITDA ratio).\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\nThe Credit Agreement, as amended, requires the Company to meet certain financial covenants. Specifically, the Company’s Total Funded Debt to EBITDA ratio may not exceed 3.50 to 1.00, and the Company’s Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio may not be less than 1.10 to 1.00. The Company’s Tangible Net Worth may not be less than $100 million plus 50% of positive Net Income for each fiscal year ending on or after June 30, 2023.\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\nBorrowings under the Credit Agreement are secured by substantially all of the Company’s personal property, including accounts receivable, inventory, machinery and equipment, and intellectual property. The Company has also pledged 100% of its equity interests in certain domestic subsidiaries and 65% of its equity interests in certain foreign subsidiaries. The Company also entered into a Collateral Assignment of Rights under Purchase Agreement for its acquisition of Veth Propulsion. To effect these security interests, the Company entered into various amendment and assignment agreements that consent to the assignment of certain agreements previously entered into between the Company and the Bank of Montreal in connection with the 2016 Credit Agreement. The Company also amended and assigned to BMO a Negative Pledge Agreement that it has previously entered into with Bank of Montreal, pursuant to which it agreed not to sell, lease or otherwise encumber real estate that it owns except as permitted by the Credit Agreement and the Negative Pledge Agreement.\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\nThe Company has also entered into a Deposit Account Control Agreement with the Bank, reflecting the Bank’s security interest in deposit accounts the Company maintains with the Bank. The Bank may not provide a notice of exclusive control of a deposit account (thereby obtaining exclusive control of the account) prior to the occurrence or existence of a Default or an Event of Default under the Credit Agreement or otherwise upon the occurrence or existence of an event or condition that would, but for the passage of time or the giving of notice, constitute a Default or an Event of Default under the Credit Agreement.\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n 15\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n---\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\xa0\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\nUpon the occurrence of an Event of Default, BMO may take the following actions upon written notice to the Company: (1) terminate its remaining obligations under the Credit Agreement; (2) declare all amounts outstanding under the Credit Agreement to be immediately due and payable; and (3) demand the Company to immediately Cash Collateralize L/C Obligations in an amount equal to 105% of the aggregate L/C Obligations or a greater amount if BMO determines a greater amount is necessary. If such Event of Default is due to the Company’s bankruptcy, the Bank may take the three actions listed above without notice to the Company.\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\nThe Company’s balance sheet remains strong, there are no material off-balance-sheet arrangements, and it continues to have sufficient liquidity for its near-term needs. The Company had approximately $33.0 million of available borrowings under the Credit Agreement as of June 30, 2023. The Company expects to continue to generate enough cash from operations, as well as its credit facilities, to meet its operating and investing needs. As of June 30, 2023, the Company also had cash of $13.3 million, primarily at its overseas operations. These funds, with some restrictions and tax implications, are available for repatriation as deemed necessary by the Company. In fiscal 2024, the Company expects to contribute $0.6 million to its defined benefit pension plans, the minimum contribution required.\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\nNet working capital decreased $3.8 million, or 3.0%, during fiscal 2023 and the current ratio (calculated as total current assets divided by total current liabilities) decreased from 2.5 at June 30, 2022 to 2.2 at June 30, 2023. The decrease in net working capital was primarily the result of an increase to trade payables ($8.0 million) and accrued liabilities ($11.0 million) resulting from growing demand and supply chain imbalances. Offsetting these movement were increases to trade receivables ($9.3 million - due to increased sales volume in the fourth quarter) and inventory ($4.8 million).\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\nThe Company expects capital expenditures to be approximately $9 million - $11 million in fiscal 2024. These anticipated expenditures reflect the Company’s plans to invest in modern equipment to drive efficiencies, quality improvements and cost reductions.\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\nManagement believes that available cash, the credit facility, cash generated from future operations, and potential access to debt markets will be adequate to fund the Company’s capital requirements for the foreseeable future.\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n*Contractual Obligations*\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\nThe Company\\'s significant contractual obligations as of June 30, 2023 are discussed in Note H “Lease Obligations” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K.\\xa0\\xa0There are no material undisclosed guarantees.\\xa0\\xa0As of June 30, 2023, the Company had no additional material purchase obligations other than those created in the ordinary course of business related to inventory and property, plant and equipment, which generally have terms of less than 90 days.\\xa0\\xa0The Company also has long-term obligations related to its postretirement plans which are discussed in detail in Note M\\xa0“Pension and Other Postretirement Benefit Plans”\\xa0in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\\xa0in Part II, Item 8 of this 2023\\xa0Annual Report on Form 10-K. Postretirement medical claims are paid by the Company as they are submitted, and they are anticipated to be $0.7\\xa0million in fiscal 2024\\xa0based on actuarial estimates; however, these amounts can vary significantly from year to year because the Company is self-insured. In fiscal 2024, the Company expects to contribute $0.6 million to its defined benefit pension plans, the minimum contribution required.\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n***Other Matters***\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\nThe preparation of this Annual Report requires management’s judgment to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. There can be no assurance that actual results will not differ from those estimates.\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n 16\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n---\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\xa0\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\nThe Company’s significant accounting policies are described in Note A, Significant Accounting Policies, of the notes to the consolidated financial statements. Not all of these significant accounting policies require management to make difficult, subjective, or complex judgments or estimates. However, the policies management considers most critical to understanding and evaluating its reported financial results are the following:\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\nAccounts Receivable\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\nThe Company performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers and adjusts credit limits based on payment history and the customer’s credit-worthiness as determined by review of current credit information. The Company continuously monitors collections and payments from its customers and maintains a provision for estimated credit losses based upon its historical experience and any specific customer-collection issues. In addition, senior management reviews the accounts receivable aging on a monthly basis to determine if any receivable balances may be uncollectible. Although the Company’s accounts receivable are dispersed among a large customer base, a significant change in the liquidity or financial position of any one of its largest customers could have a material adverse impact on the collectability of its accounts receivable and future operating results.\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\nInventory\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\nInventories are valued at the lower of cost or net realizable value (or lower of cost or market where appropriate). Cost has been determined by the last-in, first-out (LIFO) method for the majority of the inventories located in the United States, and by the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method for all other inventories. Management specifically identifies obsolete products and analyzes historical usage, forecasted production based on future orders, demand forecasts, and economic trends when evaluating the adequacy of the reserve for excess and obsolete inventory. The adjustments to the reserve are estimates that could vary significantly, either favorably or unfavorably, from the actual requirements if future economic conditions, customer demand or competitive conditions differ from expectations.\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\nAssets Held for Sale\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\nAssets that will be recovered principally through sale rather than in its continuing use in operations are reclassified out of property, plant and equipment and into assets held for sale if all of the following criteria are met: (a) management, having the authority to approve the action, commits to a plan to sell the asset(s); (b) the asset is available for immediate sale in its present condition subject only to terms that are usual and customary for sales of such assets; (c) an active program to locate a buyer, and other actions required to complete the plan to sell the asset have been initiated; (d) the sale of the asset is probable and the transfer of the asset is expected to qualify for recognition as a completed sale within a year; (e) the asset is being actively marketed for sale at a price that is reasonable in relation to its current fair value; and (f) actions required to complete the plan indicate that it is unlikely that significant changes to the plan will be made or that plan will be withdrawn.\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\nAssets held for sale are carried at fair value less costs to sell, or net book value, whichever is lower. The Company ceases to record depreciation expense at the time of designation as held for sale.\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\nLong-lived Assets\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\nThe Company reviews long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be fully recoverable. When triggering events are identified, the Company performs undiscounted operating cash flow analyses to determine if an impairment exists for property, plant and equipment and other long-lived assets, including intangible assets. If an impairment is determined to exist, any related impairment loss is calculated based on fair value. Fair value is primarily determined using discounted cash flow analyses; however, other methods may be used to substantiate the discounted cash flow analyses, including third party valuations when necessary.\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n 17\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n---\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\xa0\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\nWarranty\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\nThe Company engages in extensive product quality programs and processes, including actively monitoring and evaluating the quality of its suppliers. However, its warranty obligation is affected by product failure rates, the extent of the market affected by the failure and the expense involved in satisfactorily addressing the situation. The warranty reserve is established based on the Company’s best estimate of the amounts necessary to settle future and existing claims on products sold as of the balance sheet date. When evaluating the adequacy of the reserve for warranty costs, management takes into consideration the term of the warranty coverage, historical claim rates and costs of repair, knowledge of the type and volume of new products and economic trends. While the Company believes that the warranty reserve is adequate and that the judgment applied is appropriate, such amounts estimated to be due and payable in the future could differ materially from what actually transpires.\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\nPension and Other Postretirement Benefit Plans\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\nThe Company provides a wide range of benefits to employees and retired employees, including pensions and postretirement health care coverage. Plan assets and obligations are recorded annually based on the Company’s measurement date utilizing various actuarial assumptions such as discount rates, expected return on plan assets, compensation increases, retirement and mortality tables, and health care cost trend rates as of that date. The approach used to determine the annual assumptions are as follows:\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n|  |  |\\n| --- | --- |\\n| ● | *Discount Rate*\\xa0–\\xa0based on the Willis Towers Watson BOND:Link model at June 30, 2023 as applied to the expected payouts from the pension plans. This yield curve is made up of Corporate Bonds rated AA or better. |\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n|  |  |\\n| --- | --- |\\n| ● | *Expected Return on Plan Assets*\\xa0–\\xa0based on the expected long-term average rate of return on assets in the pension funds, which is reflective of the current and projected asset mix of the funds and considers historical returns earned on the funds. |\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n|  |  |\\n| --- | --- |\\n| ● | *Compensation Increase*\\xa0–\\xa0reflect the long-term actual experience, the near-term outlook and assumed inflation. |\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n|  |  |\\n| --- | --- |\\n| ● | *Retirement and Mortality Rates*\\xa0–\\xa0based upon the Society of Actuaries PRI-2012 base tables for annuitants and non-annuitants, adjusted for generational mortality improvement based on the Society of Actuaries modified MP-2021 projection scale. |\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n|  |  |\\n| --- | --- |\\n| ● | *Health Care Cost Trend Rates*\\xa0–\\xa0developed based upon historical cost data, near-term outlook and an assessment of likely long-term trends. |\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\nMeasurements of net periodic benefit cost are based on the assumptions used for the previous year-end measurements of assets and obligations. The Company reviews its actuarial assumptions on an annual basis and makes modifications to the assumptions when appropriate. The effects of the modifications are recorded currently or amortized over future periods. Based on information provided by its independent actuaries and other relevant sources, the Company believes that the assumptions used are reasonable; however, changes in these assumptions could impact the Company’s financial position, results of operations or cash flows.\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\nIn the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2023, the Company voluntarily changed its method of accounting for recognizing actuarial gains and losses for its defined benefit pension and postretirement benefit plans. Under the accounting method change, accumulated actuarial gains and losses as determined upon the annual remeasurement of projected benefit obligation and plan assets are recognized sooner in earnings through net periodic benefit cost within Other Income (Expense) on the Consolidated Statement of Operations and Comprehensive Income (Loss).\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\nIncome Taxes and Valuation Allowances\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The Company maintains valuation allowances when it is more likely than not that all or a portion of a deferred tax asset will not be realized. In determining whether a valuation allowance is required, the Company considers such factors as prior earnings history, expected future earnings, carry-back and carry-forward periods, and tax strategies that could potentially enhance the likelihood of realization of a deferred tax asset. Based on the above criteria the Company has determined that a full valuation allowance is appropriate as relates to its domestic operations. A full domestic valuation allowance of $22.3 million has been recognized at June 30, 2023. The recognition of a valuation allowance does not affect the availability of the tax credits as the Company realizes earnings.\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n 18\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n---\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\xa0\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n***Recently Issued Accounting Standards***\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\nSee Note A, Significant Accounting Policies, of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of recently issued accounting standards.\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n**Item 7A.\\xa0 Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure About Market Risk**\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\nThe Company is electing not to provide this disclosure due to its status as a Smaller Reporting Company.\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n**Item 8.\\xa0 Financial Statements and Supplementary** \\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\nSee Consolidated Financial Statements and Financial Statement Schedule.\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n**Item 9.\\xa0 Change in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure**\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\nNone.\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n**Item 9A.\\xa0 Controls and Procedures**\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n*Conclusion Regarding Disclosure Controls and Procedures*\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\nAs required by Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as of the end of the period covered by this report and under the supervision and with the participation of management, including the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer, the Company has evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of its disclosure controls and procedures. Based on such evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that such disclosure controls and procedures are effective to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission rules and forms, and to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the Company’s management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding disclosure.\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n*Management*’*s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting*\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\nManagement of the Company is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. The Company’s internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. The Company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that:\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n|  |  |  |\\n| --- | --- | --- |\\n|  | 1. | pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the Company, |\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n|  |  |  |\\n| --- | --- | --- |\\n|  | 2. | provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the Company, and |\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n|  |  |  |\\n| --- | --- | --- |\\n|  | 3. | provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the Company’s assets that could have a material effect on financial statements. |\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n 19\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n---\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\xa0\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies and procedures included in such controls may deteriorate.\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\nThe Company conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of its internal control over financial reporting based upon the framework (2013 edition) in Internal Control – Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Based upon such evaluation, the Company’s management concluded that its internal control over financial reporting was effective as of June 30, 2023.\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\nRSM US LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, has audited the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2023, as stated in their report which appears herein.\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n*Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting*\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\nDuring the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023, there have not been any changes in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n**Item 9B.\\xa0 Other Information**\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\nNot applicable.\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n**Item 9C.\\xa0 Disclosure Regarding Foreign Jurisdictions that Prevent Inspections**\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\nNot applicable.\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n**PART III**\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n**Item 10.\\xa0 Directors, Executive Officers and Corporate Governance**\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\nFor information with respect to the executive officers of the Registrant, see \"Information About Our Executive Officers\" at the end of Part I of this report.\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\nFor information with respect to the Directors of the Registrant, see \"Election of Directors\" in the Proxy Statement for the Annual Meeting of Shareholders to be held October 26, 2023, which is incorporated into this report by reference.\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\nFor information with respect to the Company’s Code of Ethics, see \"Guidelines for Business Conduct and Ethics” in the Proxy Statement for the Annual Meeting of Shareholders to be held October 26, 2023, which is incorporated into this report by reference.

In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of June\\xa030, 2023, based on criteria established in *Internal Control* — *Integrated Framework* issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in 2013.\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\nWe have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated financial statements of the Company and our report dated September 8, 2023 expressed an unqualified opinion.\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n**Basis for Opinion**\\n\\n\\nThe Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting in the accompanying *Management*’*s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting* in Item 9A. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audit also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n**Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting**\\n\\n\\nA company\\'s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company\\'s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the company\\'s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n/s/ RSM US LLP\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\nMilwaukee, Wisconsin\\n\\n\\nSeptember 8, 2023\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n 24\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n---\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\xa0\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n**Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm**\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\nShareholders and the Board of Directors of Twin Disc, Incorporated\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n**Opinion on the Financial Statements**\\n\\n\\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Twin Disc, Incorporated (the Company) as of June 30, 2023 and 2022, the related consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income (loss), changes in equity and cash flows for each of the two years in the period ended June\\xa030, 2023, and the related notes to the consolidated financial statements and schedule\\xa0(collectively, the financial statements). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of June 30, 2023 and 2022, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the two years in the period ended June 30, 2023, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\nWe have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public\\xa0Company Accounting Oversight Board (United\\xa0States)\\xa0(PCAOB), the Company\\'s internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2023, based on criteria established in *Internal Control* — *Integrated Framework* issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in 2013, and our report dated September 8, 2023, expressed an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the Company\\'s internal control over financial reporting.\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n**Change in Accounting Principle**\\n\\n\\nAs discussed in Note A to the consolidated financial statements, the Company has elected to change its method of accounting for actuarial gains and losses related to its pension and other postretirement benefit plans during the year ended June\\xa030, 2023. The Company adopted this change on a retrospective basis.\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n**Basis for Opinion**\\n\\n\\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n**Critical Audit**\\xa0**Matters**\\n\\n\\nThe critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n***Deferred Tax Asset Valuation Allowance***\\n\\n\\nAs described in Note N to the consolidated financial statements the Company’s gross deferred tax asset and valuation allowance was approximately $28,151,000 and $22,345,000 respectively,\\xa0respectively, as of June\\xa030, 2023. The Company recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future income tax consequences of events that have been recognized in the Company’s financial statements. Valuation allowances are provided for deferred tax assets where it is considered more likely than not that the Company will not realize the benefit of such assets. In evaluating the realizability of deferred tax assets in future periods, the available positive and negative evidence, including projected future taxable income exclusive of reversing temporary differences, history of book losses, tax planning strategies and results of recent operations, are considered.\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n 25\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n---\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\xa0\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\nWe identified management’s determination of the value of deferred tax assets as a critical audit matter as there is significant judgment required by management to conclude that it is more likely than not that these deferred tax assets will be realized in future periods. In addition, the auditing of these elements involved complex and subjective auditor judgment, including the need to involve personnel with specialized skill and knowledge.\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\nOur audit procedures to evaluate management’s determination that sufficient taxable income will not be generated to realize deferred tax assets included the following, among others:\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n|  |  |\\n| --- | --- |\\n| ● | We evaluated the design and operating effectiveness of internal controls over income taxes, specifically, those controls over the evaluation of the realizability of deferred tax assets. |\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n|  |  |\\n| --- | --- |\\n| ● | We evaluated the reasonableness of management’s estimates in regard to the ability to generate future taxable income and utilize the deferred tax assets by evaluating: (i) the forecast of future taxable income, including testing of management’s forecasts against the Company’s historical performance, and (ii) testing management’s assessment of the timing of future reversals of temporary differences. |\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n|  |  |\\n| --- | --- |\\n| ● | We utilized personnel with specialized knowledge and skill in income taxes and accounting for income taxes under Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 740 to assist in the evaluation of management’s assessment of positive and negative evidence and their conclusion that it is more likely than not that the Company will not realize the benefit of its deferred tax assets. |\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n/s/ RSM US

All significant intercompany transactions have been eliminated.\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n**Basis of Presentations**‑‑The prior period financial information in the Company’s consolidated financial statements reflects the retrospective effects from the *fourth* quarter *2023* change in accounting method related to the recognition of actuarial gains and losses for pension plans as discussed below.\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n**Management Estimates--**The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Actual amounts could differ from those estimates.\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n**Translation of Foreign Currencies**‑‑The financial statements of the Company’s non-U.S. subsidiaries are translated using the current exchange rate for assets and liabilities and the weighted-average exchange rate for the year for revenues and expenses. The resulting translation adjustments are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), which is included in equity. Gains and losses from foreign currency transactions are included in earnings. Included in other (expense) income are foreign currency transaction gain (losses) of ($373) and $714 in fiscal *2023* and *2022,* respectively.\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n**Cash**--The Company considers all highly liquid investments with original maturities of *three* months or less to be cash equivalent. Under the Company’s cash management system, cash balances at certain banks are funded when checks are presented for payment. To the extent that checks issued, but *not* yet presented for payment, exceed the balance on hand at the specific bank against which they were written, the amount of those un-presented checks is included in accounts payable. The Company maintains cash in bank accounts in excess of insured limits. The Company has *not* experienced any losses and does *not* believe that significant credit risk exists as a result of this practice.\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n**Accounts Receivable**--These represent trade accounts receivable and are stated net of an allowance for doubtful accounts of $1,221 and $1,741 at  *June 30, 2023* and *2022,* respectively. The Company records an allowance for doubtful accounts for certain customers where a risk of default has been specifically identified as well as provisions determined on a general basis when it is believed that some default is probable and estimable. The assessment of likelihood of customer default is based on a variety of factors, including the length of time the receivables are past due, the historical collection experience and existing economic conditions. Various factors  *may* adversely impact its customer’s ability to access sufficient liquidity and capital to fund their operations and render the Company’s estimation of customer defaults inherently uncertain. While the Company believes current allowances for doubtful accounts are adequate, it is possible that these factors  *may* cause higher levels of customer defaults and bad debt expense in future periods.\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n**Fair Value of Financial Instruments**--The carrying amount reported in the consolidated balance sheets for cash, trade accounts receivable and accounts payable approximate fair value because of the immediate short-term maturity of these financial instruments**.** If measured at fair value, cash would be classified as Level *1* and all other items listed above would be classified as Level *2* in the fair value hierarchy, as defined in Note M, Pension and Other Postretirement Benefit Plans. The Company’s borrowings under the revolving loan agreement, which is classified as long-term debt and consists of loans that are routinely borrowed and repaid throughout the year, approximate fair value at  *June 30, 2023.* The Company’s term loan borrowing, which is SOFR-based, approximates fair value at  *June 30, 2023.* If measured at fair value in the financial statements, long-term debt (including any current portion) would be classified as Level *2* in the fair value hierarchy.\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n*31*\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n---\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\xa0\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n**Derivative Financial Instruments**-**-**The Company has written policies and procedures that place all financial instruments under the direction of the Company’s corporate treasury department and restrict all derivative transactions to those intended for hedging purposes. The use of financial instruments for trading purposes is prohibited. The Company uses derivative financial instruments to manage certain financial risks. The Company enters into forward contracts to reduce the earnings and cash flow impact of non-functional currency denominated receivables and payables. The Company uses interest rate swap contracts to reduce the exposure to variability in interest rates on floating debt borrowings. The Company designates certain financial instruments as cash flow hedges for accounting purposes. The Company designates certain financial instruments as net investment hedges to reduce the exposure in its foreign currency denominated net investments in wholly-owned subsidiaries. See Note R, Derivative Financial Instruments, for additional information.\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n**Inventories**‑‑Inventories are valued at the lower of cost or net realizable value (or lower of cost or market where appropriate). Cost has been determined by the last‑in, first‑out (LIFO) method for the majority of inventories located in the United States, and by the first‑in, first‑out (FIFO) method for all other inventories. Management specifically identifies obsolete products and analyzes historical usage, forecasted production based on future orders, demand forecasts, and economic trends, among others, when evaluating the adequacy of the reserve for excess and obsolete inventory.\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n**Assets Held for Sale--**Assets that will be recovered principally through sale rather than in its continuing use in operations are reclassified out of property, plant and equipment and into assets held for sale if all of the following criteria are met: (a) management, having the authority to approve the action, commits to a plan to sell the asset(s); (b) the asset is available for immediate sale in its present condition subject only to terms that are usual and customary for sales of such assets; (c) an active program to locate a buyer, and other actions required to complete the plan to sell the asset have been initiated; (d) the sale of the asset is probable and the transfer of the asset is expected to qualify for recognition as a completed sale within a year; (e) the asset is being actively marketed for sale at a price that is reasonable in relation to its current fair value; and (f) actions required to complete the plan indicate that it is unlikely that significant changes to the plan will be made or that plan will be withdrawn.\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\nAssets held for sale are carried at fair value less costs to sell, or net book value, whichever is lower. The Company ceases to record depreciation expense at the time of designation as held for sale. During fiscal *2022,* the Company classified as and sold certain assets held for sale and recorded a net gain of $2,939. During fiscal *2023,* the Company classified as and sold certain assets held for sale and recorded a net gain of $4,161. See Note P, Restructuring of Operations and Income from Extinguishment of Loan, for additional information.\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n**Property, Plant and Equipment and Depreciation**‑‑Assets are stated at cost. Expenditures for maintenance, repairs and minor renewals are charged against earnings as incurred. Expenditures for major renewals and betterments are capitalized and depreciated. Depreciation is provided on the straight‑line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets. The lives assigned to buildings and related improvements range from 10 to 40 years, and the lives assigned to machinery and equipment range from 5 to 15 years. Upon disposal of property, plant and equipment, the cost of the asset and the related accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts and the resulting gain or loss is reflected in earnings. Fully depreciated assets are *not* removed from the accounts until physically disposed.\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n**Right of Use Lease Assets**‑‑In accordance with ASC *842,* the Company’s leases, with lease periods longer than *twelve* months, are recorded on the consolidated balance sheets. These leases primarily consist of office and warehouse facilities, as well as production and office equipment.\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\nThe Company determines if an arrangement is a lease at contract inception. The lease term begins upon lease commencement, which is when the Company takes possession of the asset, and  *may* include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that such options will be exercised. As its lease agreements typically do *not* provide an implicit rate, the Company primarily uses an incremental borrowing rate based upon the information available at lease commencement. In determining the incremental borrowing rate, the Company considers its current borrowing rate, the lease period, and the economic environments where the lease activity is concentrated.\\n\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n*32*\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n---\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\xa0\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n**Impairment of Long-lived Assets**--The Company reviews long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets  *may* *not* be fully recoverable. When triggering events are identified, the Company performs undiscounted operating cash flow analyses to determine if an impairment exists for property, plant and equipment and other long-lived assets, including intangible assets. If an impairment is determined to exist, any related impairment loss is calculated based on fair value. Fair value is primarily determined using discounted cash flow analyses; however, other methods  *may* be used to determine the fair value, including *third* party valuations when necessary.\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n**Intangible Assets**-- Intangible assets primarily consist of customer relationships, technology and know-how, and tradenames, all of which are definite-lived. They were initially valued at fair value at acquisition, and are amortized over their respective useful lives on the basis of straight line or accelerated, as appropriate.\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n**Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits Plans**-- The Company provides a wide range of benefits to employees and retired employees, including pensions and postretirement health care coverage. Plan assets and obligations are recorded annually based on the Company’s measurement date utilizing various actuarial assumptions such as discount rates, expected return on plan assets, compensation increases, retirement and mortality tables, and health care cost trend rates as of that date.\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n*Change in Accounting Method*\\n\\n\\nDuring the *fourth* quarter of fiscal year *2023,* the Company changed its accounting method related to the recognition of actuarial gains and losses for the Company’s pension and postretirement benefit plans (the “Accounting change”). Prior to the Accounting change, actuarial gains and losses were recognized as a component of Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) income upon annual remeasurement and were amortized into earnings in future periods when they exceeded the accounting corridor, a defined range within which amortization of net gains and losses is *not* required. Under the Accounting change, the accounting corridor of *10%* of the greater of the projected benefit obligation and plan assets was modified to add full, immediate recognition above a *second* *20%* threshold. Although the decision to make the Accounting change occurred in the *fourth* quarter of fiscal year *2023,* the actual accounting method change was applied to all calculations for fiscal year end *2023,* and retroactively applied to all other fiscal years presented in this Form *10*-K.\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\nUnder the new accounting method, actuarial gains and losses are recognized in net periodic benefit cost through a Modified mark-to-market (“MMTM”) (expense) benefit upon annual remeasurement in the *fourth* quarter, or on an interim basis as triggering events warrant remeasurement. The method for recognizing prior service credits (charges) as a component of Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and amortized into earnings in future periods is *not* changing. With respect to the recognition of actuarial gains and losses, while the historical principle was acceptable, the Company believes the Accounting change is preferable as it better aligns with fair value principles by recognizing the effects of economic and interest rate changes in plan assets and liabilities in the year in which the gains and losses are incurred to the degree such accumulated gains and losses exceed the new *20%* threshold in addition to amortizing the amounts between the *10%* and *20%* thresholds over time. The Accounting change has been applied retrospectively to prior years presented. As of  *July 1, 2022,* the cumulative effect of the change resulted in $25.1 million decrease to retained earnings and a corresponding $25.1 million increase to Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), both net of tax of $0 ($7.9 million in deferred tax asset offset by $7.9 million valuation allowance).\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\nSee Notes M and S for further information regarding the impact of the Accounting change on the Company’s current and prior consolidated financial statements.\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n*33*\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n---\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\xa0\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n**Income Taxes**--The Company recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future income tax consequences of events that have been recognized in the Company’s financial statements. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect in the years in which temporary differences are expected to reverse. Valuation allowances are provided for deferred tax assets where it is considered more likely than *not* that the Company will *not* realize the benefit of such assets. The Company evaluates its uncertain tax positions as new information becomes available. Tax benefits are recognized to the extent a position is more likely than *not* to be sustained upon examination by the taxing authority.\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n**Revenue Recognition**--Revenue from contracts with customers is recognized using a *five*-step model consisting of the following:\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n|  |  |  |\\n| --- | --- | --- |\\n|  | *1.* | **Identify the contract with a customer**; The Company’s customers consist of distributors and direct end-users. With regard to distributors, the Company generally has written distribution agreements which describe the terms of the distribution arrangement, such as the product range, the sales territory, product pricing, sales support, payment and returns policy, etc. Customer contracts are generally in the form of acknowledged purchase orders. Services to be rendered, as part of the delivery of those products, are also generally specified. Such services include installation reviews and technical commissioning. |\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n|  |  |  |\\n| --- | --- | --- |\\n|  | *2.* | **Identify the performance obligations in the contract**; The Company’s performance obligations primarily consist of product delivery and certain service obligations such as technical commissioning, repair services, installation reviews, and shift development. |\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n|  |  |  |\\n| --- | --- | --- |\\n|  | *3.* | **Determine the transaction price**; The Company considers the invoice as the transaction price. |\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n|  |  |  |\\n| --- | --- | --- |\\n|  | *4.* | **Allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract**; The Company determined that the most relevant allocation method for its service obligations is to apply the expected cost plus appropriate margin. This is the Company’s practice of billing for repairs, overhaul, and other product service related time incurred by its technicians. |\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n|  |  |  |\\n| --- | --- | --- |\\n|  | *5.* | **Recognize revenue**; Revenue is recognized as each performance obligation is satisfied which is typically when the Company transfers control of a good or service to a customer, which can occur over time or at a point in time. For technical commissioning, repairs, installation review, and shift development services, revenue is recognized upon completion of the service. The amount of revenue recognized is based on the consideration to which the Company expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services, including the expected value of variable consideration. The customer’s ability and intent to pay the transaction price is assessed in determining whether a contract exists with the customer. If collectability of substantially all of the consideration in a contract is *not* probable, consideration received is *not* recognized as revenue unless the consideration is nonrefundable and the Company *no* longer has an obligation to transfer additional goods or services to the customer or collectability becomes probable. |\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\nGoods sold to *third* party distributors are subject to an annual return policy, for which a provision is made at the time of shipment based upon historical experience. Goods sold under bill and hold arrangements are recorded as revenue when control has been transferred to the customer and when the reason for the arrangement is substantive, when the product is identified as the customer’s asset, when the product is ready for delivery to the customer, and when the Company cannot use the product or redirect the product to another customer.\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n**Shipping and Handling Fees and Costs**--The Company records revenue from shipping and handling costs in net sales. The cost associated with shipping and handling of products is reflected in cost of goods sold.\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n**Recently Adopted Accounting Standards**\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\nIn  *March 2022* and  *January 2021,* the FASB issued guidance (ASU *2022*-*04* and ASU *2023*-*01,* respectively), intended to provide optional expedients and exceptions for applying generally accepted accounting principles to contracts, hedging relationships, and other transactions affected by the discontinuation of the London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) or by another reference rate expected to be discontinued. The amendments in this guidance are effective beginning on  *March 12, 2020,* and the Company  *may* elect to apply the amendments prospectively through  *December 31, 2022.* The adoption of this guidance did *not* have a material impact on the Company’s financial statements.\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n*34*\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n---\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\xa0\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n**New Accounting Releases**\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\nIn  *June 2016,* the FASB issued updated guidance (ASU *2016*-*13*) and also issued subsequent amendments to the initial guidance under ASU *2018*-*19,* ASU *2019*-*04,* ASU *2019*-*05* and ASU *2019*-*10* (collectively ASC *326*). ASC *326* requires the measurement and recognition of expected credit losses for financial assets held at amortized cost. This replaces the existing incurred loss model with an expected loss model and requires the use of forward-looking information to calculate credit loss estimates. The amendments in this guidance are effective for filers, excluding smaller reporting companies, for fiscal years beginning after  *December 15, 2019,* and for smaller reporting companies for fiscal years beginning after  *December 15, 2022 (*the Company’s fiscal *2024*), with early adoption permitted for certain amendments. ASC *326* must be adopted by applying a cumulative effect adjustment to retained earnings. The adoption of this guidance is *not* expected to have a material impact on the Company’s financial statements.\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n**Special Note Regarding Smaller Reporting Company Status**\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\nUnder SEC Release *33*-*10513;* *34*-*83550,* Amendments to Smaller Reporting Company Definition, the Company qualifies as a smaller reporting company based on its public float as of the last business day of the *second* quarter of fiscal *2023.* Accordingly, it has scaled some of its disclosures of financial and non-financial information in this annual report. The Company will continue to determine whether to provide additional scaled disclosures of financial or non-financial information in future quarterly reports, annual reports and/or proxy statements if it remains a smaller reporting company under SEC rules.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n \\xa0\\n \\n\\n**B.\\xa0 INVENTORIES**\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\nThe major classes of inventories at  *June 30* were as follows:\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\\n|  |  | ****2023**** |  |  | ****2022**** |  |\\n| Finished parts |  | $ | 66,956 |  |  | $ | 65,789 |  |\\n| Work in process |  |  | 23,374 |  |  |  | 19,801 |  |\\n| Raw materials |  |  | 41,600 |  |  |  | 41,519 |  |\\n|  |  | $ | 131,930 |  |  | $ | 127,109 |  |\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\nInventories stated on a LIFO basis represent approximately 33% and 44% of total inventories at  *June 30, 2023* and *2022,* respectively. The approximate current cost of the LIFO inventories exceeded the LIFO cost by $30,646 and $27,797 at  *June 30, 2023* and *2022,* respectively. LIFO inventories were reduced during *2023,* resulting in a liquidation of a LIFO inventory layer that was carried at a lower cost prevailing from a prior year, as compared with current costs in the current year (“LIFO decrement”). A LIFO decrement results in the erosion of layers created in earlier years, and, therefore, a LIFO layer is *not* created for years that have decrements. For the year ended  *June 30, 2023,* the effect of this LIFO decrement decreased cost of goods sold by $3,865. There was *no* LIFO decrement for the year ended  *June 30, 2022.*\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\nThe Company had reserves for inventory obsolescence of $12,858 and $11,557 at  *June 30, 2023* and *2022,* respectively.\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n*35*\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n---\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\xa0\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n \\xa0\\n \\n\\n**C.\\xa0 PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT**\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\nProperty, plant and equipment at  *June 30* were as follows:\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\\n|  |  | ****2023**** |  |  | ****2022**** |  |\\n| Land |  | $ | 2,148 |  |  | $ | 2,163 |  |\\n| Buildings |  |  | 26,349 |  |  |  | 31,935 |  |\\n| Machinery and equipment |  |  | 148,088 |  |  |  | 146,054 |  |\\n|  |  |  | 176,585 |  |  |  | 180,152 |  |\\n| Less: accumulated depreciation |  |  | (137,935 | ) |  |  | (138,537 | ) |\\n|  |  | $ | 38,650 |  |  | $ | 41,615 |  |\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\nIncluded in the above amounts are finance lease right-of-use assets of $4,427 and $4,805 for the years ended  *June 30, 2023* and *2022,* respectively.\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\nDepreciation expense for the years ended  *June 30, 2023* and *2022* was $6,400 and $6,374, respectively.\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\xa0\\n \\n\\n**D.\\xa0 INTANGIBLE ASSETS**\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\nAt  *June 30,* the following acquired intangible assets have definite useful lives and are subject to amortization:\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\\n|  | Net Book Value Rollforward |  | Net Book Value By Asset Type |  |  |  |  |\\n|  | Gross Carrying Amount |  | Accumulated Amortization / Impairment |  | Net Book Value |  | Customer Relationships |  | Technology Know-how |  | Trade Name |  | Other |  |\\n| Balance at June 30, 2021 | $ | 41,142 |  | $ | (23,662 | ) | $ | 17,480 |  | $ | 10,321 |  | $ | 4,883 |  | $ | 1,282 |  | $ | 994 |  |\\n| Addition |  | 421 |  |  | *-* |  |  | 421 |  |  | - |  |  | - |  |  | - |  |  | 421 |  |\\n| Amortization |  | *-* |  |  | (3,173 | ) |  | (3,173 | ) |  | (1,605 | ) |  | (1,163 | ) |  | (174 | ) |  | (231 | ) |\\n| Translation adjustment |  | (1,718 | ) |  | *-* |  |  | (1,718 | ) |  | (1,080 | ) |  | (482 | ) |  | (136 | ) |  | (20 | ) |\\n| Balance at June 30, 2022 |  | 39,845 |  |  | (26,835 | ) |  | 13,010 |  |  | 7,636 |  |  | 3,238 |  |  | 972 |  |  | 1,164 |  |\\n| Addition |  | 2,204 |  |  | *-* |  |  | 2,204 |  |  | - |  |  | - |  |  | - |  |  | 2,204 |  |\\n| Reduction |  | (10,506 | ) |  | 10,506 |  |  | *-* |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\\n| Amortization |  | *-* |  |  | (2,959 | ) |  | (2,959 | ) |  | (1,340 | ) |  | (1,202 | ) |  | (39 | ) |  | (378 | ) |\\n| Translation adjustment |  | 382 |  |  | *-* |  |  | 382 |  |  | 257 |  |  | 386 |  |  | (265 | ) |  | 4 |  |\\n| Balance at June 30, 2023 | $ | 31,925 |  | $ | (19,288 | ) | $ | 12,637 |  | $ | 6,553 |  | $ | 2,422 |  | $ | 668 |  | $ | 2,994 |  |\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\nOther intangibles consist mainly of computer software.

Such warranty generally extends from periods ranging from 12 months to 24 months. The Company engages in extensive product quality programs and processes, including actively monitoring and evaluating the quality of its suppliers. However, its warranty obligation is affected by product failure rates, the number of units affected by the failure and the expense involved in satisfactorily addressing the situation. The warranty reserve is established based on the Company’s best estimate of the amounts necessary to settle future and existing claims on products sold as of the balance sheet date. When evaluating the adequacy of the reserve for warranty costs, management takes into consideration the term of the warranty coverage, historical claim rates and costs of repair, knowledge of the type and volume of new products and economic trends. While the Company believes that the warranty reserve is adequate and that the judgment applied is appropriate, such amounts estimated to be due and payable in the future could differ materially from what actually transpires. The following is a listing of the activity in the warranty reserve during the years ended  *June 30:*\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\\n|  |  | ****2023**** |  |  | ****2022**** |  |\\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\\n| Reserve balance, July 1 |  | $ | 3,329 |  |  | $ | 4,369 |  |\\n| Current period expense and adjustments |  |  | 2,451 |  |  |  | 1,570 |  |\\n| Payments or credits to customers |  |  | (2,268 | ) |  |  | (2,501 | ) |\\n| Translation adjustment |  |  | (36 | ) |  |  | (109 | ) |\\n| Reserve balance, June 30 |  | $ | 3,476 |  |  | $ | 3,329 |  |\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\nThe current portion of the warranty accrual ($2,970 and $2,724 for fiscal *2023* and *2022,* respectively) is reflected in accrued liabilities, while the long-term portion ($506 and $605 for fiscal *2023* and *2022,* respectively) is included in other long-term liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets.\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n*37*\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n---\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\xa0\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n \\xa0\\n \\n\\n**G.\\xa0 DEBT**\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\nLong-term debt consisted of the following at  *June 30:*\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\\n|  |  | ****2023**** |  |  | ****2022**** |  |\\n| Credit Agreement Debt |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\\n| Revolving loans (expire June 2025) |  | $ | 7,094 |  |  | $ | 22,968 |  |\\n| Term loan (due March 2026) |  |  | 11,500 |  |  |  | 13,500 |  |\\n| Other |  |  | 33 |  |  |  | 75 |  |\\n| Subtotal |  |  | 18,627 |  |  |  | 36,543 |  |\\n| Less: current maturities |  |  | (2,010 | ) |  |  | (2,000 | ) |\\n| Total long-term debt |  | $ | 16,617 |  |  | $ | 34,543 |  |\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n**Credit Agreement Debt**:\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\nOn  *June 29, 2018,* the Company entered into a Credit Agreement (the “Credit Agreement”) with BMO Harris Bank N.A. (“BMO”) that provided for the assignment and assumption of the previously existing loans between the Company and Bank of Montreal (the *“2016* Credit Agreement”) and subsequent amendments into a term loan (the “Term Loan”) and revolving credit loans (each a “Revolving Loan” and, collectively, the “Revolving Loans,” and, together with the Term Loan, the “Loans”). Pursuant to the Credit Agreement, BMO agreed to make the Term Loan to the Company in a principal amount *not* to exceed $35.0 million and the Company  *may,* from time to time prior to the maturity date, enter into Revolving Loans in amounts *not* to exceed, in the aggregate, $50.0 million (the “Revolving Credit Commitment”), subject to a Borrowing Base based on Eligible Inventory and Eligible Receivables. Subsequent amendments to the Credit Agreement reduced the Term Loan to $20.0 million, extended the maturity date of the Term Loan to  *March 4, 2026,* and require the Company to make principal installment payments on the Term Loan of $0.5 million per quarter. In addition, under subsequent amendments to the Credit Agreement, BMO’s Revolving Credit Commitment is currently $40.0 million. The Credit Agreement also allows the Company to obtain Letters of Credit from BMO, which if drawn upon by the beneficiary thereof and paid by BMO, would become Revolving Loans. Under the Credit Agreement, the Company  *may* *not* pay cash dividends on its common stock in excess of $3.0 million in any fiscal year. The term of the Revolving Loans under the Credit Agreement currently runs through  *June 30, 2025.*\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\nUnder the Credit Agreement as amended, interest rates are based on either the secured overnight financing rate (“SOFR”) or the euro interbank offered rate (the “EURIBO Rate”). Loans are designated either as “SOFR Loans,” which accrue interest at an Adjusted Term SOFR plus an Applicable Margin, or “Eurodollar Loans,” which accrue interest at the EURIBO Rate plus an Applicable Margin. Amounts drawn on a Letter of Credit that are *not* timely reimbursed to the Bank bear interest at a Base Rate plus an Applicable Margin. The Company also pays a commitment fee on the average daily Unused Revolving Credit Commitment equal to an Applicable Margin. Currently, the Applicable Margins are between 1.25% and 2.75% for Revolving Loans and Letters of Credit; 1.375% and 2.875% for Term Loans; and 0.10% and 0.15% for the Unused Revolving Credit Commitment (each depending on the Company’s Total Funded Debt to EBITDA ratio).\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\nThe Credit Agreement, as amended, requires the Company to meet certain financial covenants. Specifically, the Company’s Total Funded Debt to EBITDA ratio  *may* *not* exceed 3.50 to *1.00,* and the Company’s Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio  *may* *not* be less than 1.10 to *1.00.* The Company’s Tangible Net Worth  *may* *not* be less than $100 million plus *50%* of positive Net Income for each fiscal year ending on or after  *June 30, 2023.*\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\nBorrowings under the Credit Agreement are secured by substantially all of the Company’s personal property, including accounts receivable, inventory, machinery and equipment, and intellectual property. The Company has also pledged 100% of its equity interests in certain domestic subsidiaries and 65% of its equity interests in certain foreign subsidiaries. The Company also entered into a Collateral Assignment of Rights under Purchase Agreement for its acquisition of Veth Propulsion. To effect these security interests, the Company entered into various amendment and assignment agreements that consent to the assignment of certain agreements previously entered into between the Company and the Bank of Montreal in connection with the *2016* Credit Agreement. The Company also amended and assigned to BMO a Negative Pledge Agreement that it has previously entered into with Bank of Montreal, pursuant to which it agreed *not* to sell, lease or otherwise encumber real estate that it owns except as permitted by the Credit Agreement and the Negative Pledge Agreement.\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n*38*\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n---\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\xa0\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nThe Company has also entered into a Deposit Account Control Agreement with the Bank, reflecting the Bank’s security interest in deposit accounts the Company maintains with the Bank. The Bank  *may* *not* provide a notice of exclusive control of a deposit account (thereby obtaining exclusive control of the account) prior to the occurrence or existence of a Default or an Event of Default under the Credit Agreement or otherwise upon the occurrence or existence of an event or condition that would, but for the passage of time or the giving of notice, constitute a Default or an Event of Default under the Credit Agreement.\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\n\\nUpon the occurrence of an Event of Default, BMO  *may* take the following actions upon written notice to the Company: (*1*) terminate its remaining obligations under the Credit Agreement; (*2*) declare all amounts outstanding under the Credit Agreement to be immediately due and payable; and (*3*) demand the Company to immediately Cash Collateralize L/C Obligations in an amount equal to 105% of the aggregate L/C Obligations or a greater amount if BMO determines a greater amount is necessary. If such Event of Default is due to the Company’s bankruptcy, BMO  *may* take the *three* actions listed above without notice to the Company.\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n**The PPP Loan:**\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\nOn  *April 17, 2020,* the Company entered into a promissory note (the “PPP Loan”) evidencing an unsecured loan in the amount of $8,200 made to the Company under the Payment Protection Plan (\"PPP\"). The PPP is a liquidity facility program established by the U.S. government as part of the CARES Act in response to the negative economic impact of the COVID-*19* outbreak. The PPP Loan is funded by the Small Business Administration (“SBA”) and administered by BMO. The PPP Loan has a *two*-year term and bears interest at a rate of *1.0%* per annum. Monthly principal and interest payments were deferred until  *April 2022.*\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\nThe PPP Loan is a forgivable loan to the extent proceeds are used to cover qualified documented payroll, mortgage interest, rent, and utility costs over a *24*-week measurement period (as amended) following loan funding. For the loan to be forgiven, the Company was required to formally apply for forgiveness, and potentially, could be required to pass an audit that it met the eligibility qualifications of the loan.\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\nIn accounting for the terms of the PPP Loan, the Company is guided by ASC *470* *Debt*, and ASC *450*-*30* *Gain contingency*. Accordingly, it recorded the proceeds of the PPP Loan of *$8,200* as debt and derecognized the liability when the loan was forgiven. The Company believed that the possibility of loan forgiveness was to be regarded as a contingent gain and therefore did *not* recognize the gain (and derecognize the loan) until all uncertainty was removed (i.e., all conditions for forgiveness are met). The Company applied for forgiveness, and on  *June 16, 2021,* it was notified by BMO that the SBA remitted funds to BMO to repay the PPP Loan in full, evidencing that the PPP Loan was fully forgiven. The Company removed the balance of the PPP Loan from its consolidated balance sheet and recorded $8,200 in income from extinguishment of loan in its consolidated statement of operations in fiscal *2021.*\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\nWhile the loan has been formally forgiven, under the terms of the PPP Loan, the Company remains subject to an audit by the SBA for a period of *six* years after forgiveness. The audit is intended to confirm the Company’s eligibility for the PPP loan and the appropriateness of the PPP loan forgiveness. In accordance with ASC *450* *Contingencies*, the Company assessed the probability of failing the audit and being required to repay all or any portion of the PPP Loan. The Company is aware of the requirements and has retained all necessary documentation in support of its eligibility, including gross receipts calculations, supporting payroll expenses and related information. The Company believes that it has materially complied with all the requirements of the PPP and reasonably assured it would satisfy the requirements of an audit.\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n**Other:**\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\nOther long-term debt pertains mainly to a financing arrangement in Europe. During fiscal *2019,* the Company entered into sale leaseback agreements with a leasing company covering various company vehicles. Under the terms of the agreements, the Company received $329 in cash proceeds and agreed to lease back those same vehicles under various terms, ranging from 3 to 5 years. Under ASC *842,* *Leases*, these agreements are required to be accounted for as financing transactions. Consequently, the Company recorded long-term liabilities for the proceeds received, and they are reduced as lease payments are made. These liabilities carry implied interest rates ranging from 7% to 25%. A total amount of $37 in principal was paid on these liabilities during the current fiscal year.\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n*39*\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n---\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\xa0\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nDuring fiscal year *2023,* the average interest rate was 5.72% on the Term Loan, and 4.64% on the Revolving Loans.\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\nAs of  *June 30, 2023,* the Company’s borrowing capacity under the terms of the Credit Agreement was approximately $44,056 and the Company had approximately $32,906 of available borrowings.\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\nThe Company’s borrowings described above approximates fair value at  *June 30, 2023* and  *June 30, 2022.* If measured at fair value in the financial statements, long-term debt (including the current portion) would be classified as Level *2* in the fair value hierarchy.\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\nThe Company is party to an interest rate swap arrangement with Bank of Montreal, with an outstanding notional amount of $11,500 as of  *June 30, 2023,* and maturing on  *March 2026.* This swap has been designated as a cash flow hedge under ASC *815,* *Derivatives and Hedging*.

Domestic plan benefits are based on years of service, and, for salaried employees, on average compensation for benefits earned prior to  *January 1, 1997,* and on a cash balance plan for benefits earned from  *January 1, 1997* through  *July 31, 2009,* at which time the Company froze future accruals under domestic defined benefit pension plans. To reduce administration costs, in  *December 2022,* the Company merged its domestic hourly and salaried defined benefit pension plans into a single plan.\\xa0 Due to the merger, an interim remeasurement was required which resulted in a net measurement loss (gain on liability offset by loss on assets) which increased the net liability from an expected amount of $1.5 million to a measured amount of $2.6 million.\\xa0 Lower future administrative costs are expected to be favorable to the net liability in subsequent measurements.\\xa0 The Company\\'s funding policy for the plans covering domestic employees is to contribute an actuarially determined amount which falls between the minimum required contribution and maximum amount that can be deducted for federal income tax purposes.\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\nIn addition, the Company has unfunded, non-qualified retirement plans for certain management employees and Directors. In the case of management employees, benefits are based on an annual credit to a bookkeeping account, intended to restore the benefits that would have been earned under the qualified plans, but for the earnings limitations under the Internal Revenue Code. In the case of Directors, benefits are based on years of service on the Board. All benefits vest upon retirement from the Company.\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\nIn addition to providing pension benefits, the Company provides other postretirement benefits, including healthcare and life insurance benefits for certain domestic retirees. All employees retiring after  *December 31, 1992,* and electing to continue healthcare coverage through the Company\\'s group plan, are required to pay 100% of the premium cost.\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\nThe measurement date for the Company’s pension and postretirement benefit plans in fiscal *2023* and *2022* was  *June 30.*\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\nAs discussed in Note A, during the *fourth* quarter of fiscal year *2023,* the Company changed its accounting method related to the recognition of actuarial gains and losses for its pension and postretirement benefit plans. Under the new method, actuarial gains and losses are recognized in net periodic benefit costs upon annual remeasurement in the *fourth* quarter, or on an interim basis as triggering events warrant remeasurement. These changes have been applied retrospectively to prior years presented below. See Notes A and S for further information regarding the impact of the change in accounting principle on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\nThe (income) cost to the Company of its retirement benefit plans is shown in the following table:\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n|  |  |  |  |\\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\\n|  |  | ****Year Ended June 30**** |  |\\n|  |  | ****Pension Benefits**** |  |  | ****Other Postretirement Benefits**** |  |\\n|  |  | ****2023**** |  |  | ****2022**** |  |  | ****2023**** |  |  | ****2022**** |  |\\n| **Components of net periodic benefit (income) cost** |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\\n| Service cost |  | $ | 338 |  |  | $ | 511 |  |  | $ | 10 |  |  | $ | 14 |  |\\n| Interest cost |  |  | 3,570 |  |  |  | 2,473 |  |  |  | 213 |  |  |  | 140 |  |\\n| Prior service cost |  |  | 20 |  |  |  | 40 |  |  |  | -

The Committee works with external actuaries and investment consultants on an ongoing basis to establish and monitor investment strategies and target asset allocations. The overall objective of the Committee’s investment strategy is to earn a rate of return over time to satisfy the benefit obligations of the pension plans and to maintain sufficient liquidity to pay benefits and address other cash requirements of the pension plans. The Committee has established an Investment Policy Statement which provides written documentation of the Company’s expectations regarding its investment programs for the pension plans, establishes objectives and guidelines for the investment of the plan assets consistent with the Company’s financial and benefit-related goals, and outlines criteria and procedures for the ongoing evaluation of the investment program. The Company employs a total return on investment approach whereby a mix of investments among several asset classes are used to maximize long-term return of plan assets while avoiding excessive risk. Investment risk is measured and monitored on an ongoing basis through quarterly investment portfolio reviews, and annual liability measurements.\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\nThe Company’s pension plan weighted-average asset allocations at  *June 30, 2023* and *2022* by asset category were as follows (based on the fair value of level *1* assets and Net Asset Value):\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\\n|  |  | Target |  |  | ****30-Jun**** |  |\\n| Asset Category |  | Allocation |  |  | ****2023**** |  |  | ****2022**** |  |\\n| Equity securities |  |  | 43 | % |  |  | 40 | % |  |  | 40 | % |\\n| Debt securities |  |  | 50 | % |  |  | 49 | % |  |  | 49 | % |\\n| Real estate |  |  | 7 | % |  |  | 11 | % |  |  | 11 | % |\\n|  |  |  | 100 | % |  |  | 100 | % |  |  | 100 | % |\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\nDue to market conditions and other factors, actual asset allocation  *may* vary from the target allocation outlined above.

Changes in valuation allowances from period to period are included in the tax provision in the period of change. In determining whether a valuation allowance is required, the Company takes into account such factors as prior earnings history, expected future earnings, carry-back and carry-forward periods, and tax strategies that could potentially enhance the likelihood of realization of a deferred tax asset. The Company has evaluated the likelihood of whether the net deferred tax assets would be realized and concluded that it is more likely than *not* that all of deferred tax assets would *not* be realized. Management believes that it is more likely than *not* that the results of future operations will *not* generate sufficient taxable income and foreign source income to realize all the domestic deferred tax assets, therefore, a valuation allowance in the amount of $22,345 and $23,097\\xa0have been recorded for fiscal year *2023* and *2022,* respectively.\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\nFollowing is a reconciliation of the applicable U.S. federal income taxes to the actual income taxes reflected in the statements of operations:\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\\n|  |  | ******2023****** |  |  | ******2022****** |  |\\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\\n| U.S. federal income tax at 21% |  | $ | 3,038 |  |  | $ | 2,648 |  |\\n| *Increases (reductions) in tax resulting from:* |  |  |  |  |  |\\n| Foreign rate differences |  |  | 739 |  |  |  | 438 |  |\\n| U.S. inclusion of foreign tax items |  |  | 67 |  |  |  | 12 |  |\\n| Foreign permanent differences |  |  | 20 |  |  |  | (578 | ) |\\n| \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0Foreign prior period adjustments |  |  | 166 |  |  |  | (465 | ) |\\n| \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0Foreign other |  |  | (90 | ) |  |  | 18 |  |\\n| State taxes |  |  | 69 |  |  |  | 46 |  |\\n| Change in prior year estimate |  |  | (113 | ) |  |  | 372 |  |\\n| Research and development tax credits |  |  | (127 | ) |  |  | (10 | ) |\\n| Unrecognized tax benefits |  |  | 64 |  |  |  | (152 | ) |\\n| Stock compensation |  |  | (13 | ) |  |  | (46 | ) |\\n| Rate changes |  |  | (39 | ) |  |  | 121 |  |\\n| Deferred tax basis adjustments |  |  | 41 |  |  |  | (54 | ) |\\n| Executive compensation |  |  | 219 |  |  |  | 42 |  |\\n| GILTI inclusion |  |  | 97 |  |  |  | 920 |  |\\n| Valuation allowance |  |  | (426 | ) |  |  | (1,539 | ) |\\n| Other, net |  |  | 76 |  |  |  | 50 |  |\\n|  |  | $ | 3,788 |  |  | $ | 1,823 |  |\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n**Executive Compensation Limitations:** IRC Section *162*(m) limits the deduction for compensation paid by a publicly held corporation to certain of its executive employees to *$1,000* per year. The definition of “covered employee” includes the Company’s named executive officers. These are the corporation’s principal executive officer, principal financial officer, and the next *three* highest-paid executive officers. Prior exemptions for commissions and performance-based compensation were eliminated under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “TCJA”).

The High Tax Exception (HTE) rules were finalized and applicable for the company during fiscal year *2021.* Accordingly, the company  *may* exclude from the GILTI inclusion tested income from tested units with an effective tax rate greater than 18.9%.

An incentive for C corporations to generate revenue from serving foreign markets, the provision applies a preferential tax rate to eligible income. The new tax law assumes a fixed rate of return on a corporation’s tangible assets. Any remaining income is deemed to be generated by intangible assets.

The Company reaffirms its position that the earnings of those subsidiaries remain permanently invested and has *no* plans to repatriate funds from any permanently reinvested subsidiaries to the U.S. for the foreseeable future. These earnings relate to ongoing operations and were approximately $24,612 and $14,175 at  *June 30, 2023* and  *June 30, 2022,* respectively. Such earnings could become taxable upon the sale or liquidation of these foreign subsidiaries or upon dividend repatriation.

Under the new method, actuarial gains and losses are recognized in net periodic benefit costs upon annual remeasurement in the *fourth* quarter, or on an interim basis as triggering events warrant remeasurement. These changes have been applied retrospectively to prior years. See Notes A, M and S for further information regarding the impact of the change in accounting principle on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n \\xa0\\n \\n\\n**R.\\xa0 DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS**\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\nThe Company reports all derivative instruments on its consolidated balance sheets at fair value and establishes criteria for designation and effectiveness of transactions entered into for hedging purposes.\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\nAs a global organization, the Company faces exposure to market risks, such as fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates and commodity prices. To manage the volatility relating to these exposures, the Company enters into various derivative instruments from time to time under its risk management policies. The Company designates derivative instruments as hedges on a transaction basis to support hedge accounting. The changes in fair value of these hedging instruments offset in part or in whole corresponding changes in the fair value or cash flows of the underlying exposures being hedged. The Company assesses the initial and ongoing effectiveness of its hedging relationships in accordance with its policy. The Company does *not* purchase, hold or sell derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. The Company’s practice is to terminate derivative transactions if the underlying asset or liability matures or is sold or terminated, or if it determines the underlying forecasted transaction is *no* longer probable of occurring.\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n*Interest Rate Swaps Designated as Cash Flow Hedges*\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\nThe primary purpose of the Company’s cash flow hedging activities is to manage the potential changes in value associated with interest payments on the Company’s SOFR-based indebtedness. The Company records gains and losses on interest rate swap contracts qualifying as cash flow hedges in accumulated other comprehensive loss to the extent that these hedges are effective and until the Company recognizes the underlying transactions in net earnings, at which time these gains and losses are recognized in interest expense on its consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income (loss). Cash flows from derivative financial instruments are classified as cash flows from financing activities on the consolidated statements of cash flows. These contracts generally have original maturities of greater than *twelve* months.\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n*58*\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n---\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\xa0\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nNet unrealized after-tax losses related to cash flow hedging activities that were included in accumulated other comprehensive loss were ($688) and ($356) for the years ended  *June 30, 2023* and *2022,* respectively. The unrealized amounts in accumulated other comprehensive loss will fluctuate based on changes in the fair value of open contracts during each reporting period.\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\nThe Company estimates that ($293) of net unrealized losses related to cash flow hedging activities included in accumulated other comprehensive loss will be reclassified into earnings within the next *twelve* months.\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n*Derivatives Designated as Net Investment Hedges*\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\nThe Company is exposed to foreign currency exchange risk related to its investment in net assets in foreign countries. As discussed in Note G, Debt, during the *fourth* quarter of fiscal *2021,* the Company designated its euro denominated Revolving Loan, with a notional amount of €13,500, as a net investment hedge to mitigate the risk of variability in its euro denominated net investments in wholly-owned foreign subsidiaries. All changes in fair value of the euro revolver were then reported in accumulated other comprehensive loss along with the foreign currency translation adjustments on those foreign investments. Net unrealized after-tax income related to net investment hedging activities that were included in accumulated other comprehensive loss were ($1,272) and ($1,550) for the years ended  *June 30, 2023* and *2022,* respectively.\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n*Foreign Currency Forward Contracts *Not* Designated as Hedges*\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\nThe Company primarily enters into forward exchange contracts to reduce the earnings and cash flow impact of non-functional currency denominated receivables and payables. These contracts are highly effective in hedging the cash flows attributable to changes in currency exchange rates. Gains and losses resulting from these contracts offset the foreign exchange gains or losses on the underlying assets and liabilities being hedged. The maturities of the forward exchange contracts generally coincide with the settlement dates of the related transactions. Gains and losses on these contracts are recorded in other expense, net in the consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive income (loss) as the changes in the fair value of the contracts are recognized and generally offset the gains and losses on the hedged items in the same period. The primary currency to which the Company was exposed in fiscal *2023* and *2022* was the euro. At  *June 30, 2023* and *2022,* there were *no* significant forward exchange contracts outstanding.\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n*Other Derivative Instruments*\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\nThe Company does *not* utilize commodity price hedges to manage commodity price risk exposure. Likewise, the Company does *not* hedge the translation exposure represented by the net assets of its foreign subsidiaries.\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n*Fair Value of Derivative Instruments*\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\nThe Company’s interest rate swaps and foreign currency forward contracts are recorded at fair value on the consolidated balance sheets using a discounted cash flow analysis that incorporates observable market inputs. These market inputs include foreign currency spot and forward rates, and various interest rate curves, and are obtained from pricing data quoted by various banks, *third*-party sources and foreign currency dealers involving identical or comparable instruments (Level *2*).\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\nCounterparties to these foreign currency forward contracts have at least an investment grade rating. Credit ratings on some of the Company’s counterparties  *may* change during the term of the financial instruments. The Company closely monitors its counterparties’ credit ratings and, if necessary, will make any appropriate changes to its financial instruments. The fair value generally reflects the estimated amounts that the Company would receive or pay to terminate the contracts at the reporting date.\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\nAs discussed in Note G, Debt, the Company\\'s euro denominated Revolving Loan approximates fair value at  *June 30, 2023* and  *June 30, 2022.* If measured at fair value in the financial statements, it would be classified as Level *2* in the fair value hierarchy.\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n*59*\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n---\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\xa0\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nThe fair value of derivative instruments included in the
